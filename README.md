# Prefabricated House Manufacturers

This is the second MVC project that code bootcamp graduates can try their hand at. 'Prefab' is a page that lists bookmarks for a particular topic, but also includes user authentication and form functionality to add the bookmarks through a web interface.

The instruction page can be seen here: http://after-bootcamp-website.herokuapp.com/projects/prefab

And the resulting web-app is shown here: http://prefab-after-bootcamp.herokuapp.com/
